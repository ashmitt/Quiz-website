## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Troubleshooting Local Setup

> **Note**
> We have found that some local machine configurations (proxies, firewalls, network settings) can make it difficult to run the development server. If you encounter persistent issues, the fastest way to see the project in action is to deploy it directly to Netlify.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v14 or higher)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quiz-website.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Quiz-website
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5173`.
